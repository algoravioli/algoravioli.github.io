      <h3>A little bit about me.</h3>
      <h6>
        PhD candidate at SUTD (Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence, Audio
        DSP specialisation) with a passion for reducing resources in Scientific
        Computing.
      </h6>
      <p>
        My research revolves around a general approach for utilising smal neural
        networks (cf. <a href="#">Papers/Publications</a>) to achieve greater
        realtime speeds (less than 5Âµs for inference). This is done in hopes of
        relegating our reliance on extremely power-consuming and expensive GPUs
        to the past. This happens to apply well in the realm of audio DSP, as it
        allows for realtime performance (at audio rates) of complex audio
        processing algorithms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having been the chief engineer at Speakeasy Studios, with more than 10
        years of experience in audio engineering, I founded OCCD AUDIO, a
        company specialising in audio technologies. It is my current passion
        project, where I design unique analog compressors, EQs, and tube
        microphones, and I work with artists and audio engineers to produce
        analog hardware processors (and sometimes DSP) that are specific to
        their use case.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have also been involved with work as a Music Technologist, with my
        main focus being on generative algorithms and stochastic modelling. Some
        of my past works include: sonification of a neural network for
        performance analysis and AI-enabled/AI-powered audio/music generation,
        real-time deployments of autonomous agents for music generation. My
        latest work: Music Virutal Corpus, is a collection of Machine
        Learning/AI tools for composers, sound designers, and music producers.
        These tools have been abstracted such that only a basic utilitarian
        knowledge of programming is required to use them.
