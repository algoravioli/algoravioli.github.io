          <h2>About Christopher</h2>
          <p>
            Christopher Johann Clarke, PhD in Artificial Intelligence and
            Machine learning with a specialisation in audio design and digital
            signal processing (DSP). My passion lies with low-latency audio
            plugin/framework implementations, particularly for applications that
            have traditionally been deemed otherwise. My PhD thesis focuses on
            the utilisation of AI/ML technologies to run extremely low-latency
            (microsecond and below) audio processing, even on low-compute
            devices such as embedded microcontrollers or System-on-a-Chip. As a
            Music Technologist with focus on generative algorithms and
            stochastic modelling for music generation, I have presented fixed
            site-specific installations and deployed software libraries on music
            generation. Functionally, I have served roles as Project Manager,
            Tech Lead, interrim CTO, and Chief Engineer, managing internal and
            external stakeholders, and worked across cross-functional
            multidisciplinary teams.

        <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I once programmed a synth patch that mimicked the sound of a singing
            kettle.

            My favorite debugging snack is a tie between salted caramel ice
            cream and spicy nachos.
          </li>
          <li>
            When I'm not coding or composing, I'm probably mountain biking or
            brewing espresso.
